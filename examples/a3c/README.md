A3C implementation for BTgym.

****
###### This implementation is based on `Universal Starter Agent` from `OPenAI`: https://github.com/openai/universe-starter-agent

##### THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS:
This folder contains examples of applying A3C to BTgym environments.
All materials published here
are preliminary and un-categorized results of ongoing research and may contain repetitions, errors, misconceptions,
dead-ends etc. and generally are subject to change.
It's recommended to go straight to most recent added ones to save time.

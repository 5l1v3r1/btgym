The idea is to implement  OpenAI Gym environment for Backtrader backtesting/trading library to test some
reinforcement learning algorithms in algo-trading domain.

Backtrader is open-source algorithmic trading library, well structured and maintained at:
http://github.com/mementum/backtrader
http://www.backtrader.com/

OpenAI Gym is.., well, everyone knows OpenAI.
http://github.com/openai/gym

The project in early pre-pre-alpha stage and you are likely to only find chunks of code and notebooks at the moment.
